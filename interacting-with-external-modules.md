# ðŸ“¡ Interacting with External Modules

If you need to interact with external modes (i.e. not deployed from your Scaffold Move repo) you can add external module data either:&#x20;

### &#x20;Edit externalModules.ts

Manually, by adding the module ABI's to your packages/nextjs/modules/externalModules.ts.

```
/**
 * @example
 * const externalModules = {
 *   1: {
 *     treasury: {
 *       bytecode: "0x...",
 *       abi: {
           address: "0x...",
           name: "treasury",
           friends: [...],
           exposed_functions: [...],
           structs: [...]
         },
 *     },
 *   },
 * } as const;
 */
```

In the example above, it shows some dummy values for adding a treasury module deployed on mainnet (chainId 1).

### Edit Move.toml

By adding the addresses of the external modules to your packages/move/Move.toml file, the externalModules.ts file will get updated automatically. The post deploy script will update the externalModules.ts file with the modules linked to all addresses added in Move.toml after each deployment.

```
[package]
name = 'onchain_bio'
version = '1.0.0'
[dependencies.AptosFramework]
git = 'https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git'
rev = 'main'
subdir = 'aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework'                                                                                                                                                                                            
[addresses]
OnchainBio='0x1f61b83497e279044679e283e66513e6bb50d4e3145ceed7218fa443d91450ec'
OtherModule='0x0a596e253fe1584d6c04bbc9c662faaa1e41a6141f2a458f52d5e5512e38fb9a'
```

This is the move.toml file that is shipped with the Scaffold Move repo by default. The OtherModule field declares the address of the external modules. You can add multiple addresses here, as long as their names are unique. The naming is purely for your own reference, as the module names will be fetched from the blockchain when updating the externalModules.ts file.
