# üôè Contributing to Scaffold Move

Scaffold Move has successfully implemented core features essential for Move developers, providing a robust foundation for building decentralized applications. The current version offers a streamlined development experience with hot module reloading, custom hooks, and seamless wallet integration.

### New features planned:

- Add a testing framework for Move modules.
- Add custom networks to network switching. This is currently not available in the Aptos Wallet Adapter. Once [our PR](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/pull/425) is merged, this feature will be added to Scaffold Move.
- Enhance documentation and tutorials for easier onboarding.
- Migrate documentation from Gitbook to Docusaurus.
- Develop additional pre-built components for common dApp functionalities.
- Integrate different templates/configurations (similar to [create-aptos-dapp](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp))

### Contributing
